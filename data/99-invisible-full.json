The military regime dissolved the congress, took control of the media and went about dismantling the socialist and democratic institutions that Allende’s government had built. In the midst of this takeover, the military discovered a strange room in a nondescript office building in downtown Santiago. The room was hexagonal in shape with seven white fiberglass chairs arranged in an inward facing circle.

It was a nexus of creativity in the early 20th century. Many now-famous designers and artists who were in Europe during the 1920s and ’30s spent time at the Bauhaus. The popularity and influence of the Bauhaus beyond Germany, however, owes a great deal to a lesser-known photographer: Lucia Moholy.

It was the first documentary, in any medium, to explore what happened that night, and it weaves together the perspectives of survivors, historians, and people who were deeply affected by the events that night.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/B7SfAkjI3BE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\">","image":{"url":"http://cdn.99percentinvisible.org/wp-content/uploads/powerpress/99invisible-logo-1400.jpg","type":"image"}},{"type":"episode","id":150247740,"slug":"217-home-on-lagrange","explicit":false,"mediaType":"audio/mpeg","title":"217- Home on Lagrange","minimalTitle":"Home on Lagrange","url":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/UfYyx5u4xR0/217-Home-on-Lagrange.mp3","home":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~3/LiIlYCUyNs8/","publishedAt":1466554932,"lookup":"https://player.fm/series/116582/150247740.json","share":"https://player.fm/1eQdkN","size":27936565,"duration":1889,"description":"In 1968, an Italian industrialist and a Scottish scientist started a club to address what they considered to be humankind’s greatest problems—issues like pollution, resource scarcity, and overpopulation. Meeting in Rome, Italy, the group came to be known as the Club of Rome and it grew to include politicians, scientists, economists and business leaders from around the world. Together with a group of MIT researchers doing computer modeling, The Club of Rome concluded that sometime in the 21st century, earth would reach its carrying capacity—that resources would not keep up with population—and there would be a massive collapse of global society. In 1972, the Club of Rome published a book outlining their findings called The Limits to Growth. The book became a bestseller and was translated into more than two dozen languages. It had its critics and detractors, but overall The Limits to Growth was incredibly influential, shaping environmental politics and pop culture for years to come. There was a growing sense that limits would need to be put in place in order to regulate populations and economic growth. But in the midst of the debate, a physicist named Gerard (Gerry) O’Neill suggested a solution—one that would ask us to look beyond planet earth and into outer space.

It’s been through a lot of iterations. In the 1650s, a handful of freed slaves were the neighborhood’s first residents. At the time, New York was still a Dutch colony called New Amsterdam, and the Lower East Side was farm land. In the early 1800s, The Bowery had become a bustling thoroughfare with elegant theaters, and taverns, and shops. But by the late 1800s it had become a much seedier place, full of saloons, and dance halls, and prostitution. By the 1940s, The Bowery had become New York’s skid row—a place where down-and-out men could go and rent a cheap room for the night in one of the neighborhood’s many flop houses. Now, of course, Lower Manhattan affords no room for a skid row. The Bowery, like the rest of that area, is full of expensive places to live, and fancy grocery stores. But back in 1998, before the last of the flop hotels closed their doors, David Isay and Stacy Abramson spent months documenting one of the last of these places: The Sunshine Hotel.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/6RhWQ54wSJM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\">"},{"type":"episode","id":122375731,"slug":"174-from-the-sea-freedom","explicit":false,"mediaType":"audio/mpeg","title":"174- From the Sea, Freedom","minimalTitle":"From the Sea, Freedom","url":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/r5JDBNZzswc/174-From-the-Sea-Freedom.mp3","home":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~3/ySolnzfagSg/","publishedAt":1438142509,"lookup":"https://player.fm/series/116582/122375731.json","share":"https://player.fm/1ZCcYV","size":19730359,"duration":1376,"description":"In 1933, delegates from the United States and fourteen other countries met in Montevideo, Uruguay to define what it means to be a state.

The state as a person of international law should possess the following qualifications: 1. A defined territory 2. A permanent population 3. A government 4. Capacity to enter into relations with the other states Over time, some people got to thinking that the criteria for becoming a state seemed surprisingly simple. So simple, that some attempted to declare their house an independent country. So-called “micronations” popped up around the world. Most of these micronations aren’t expecting anyone to take them seriously, and many don’t even meet all four criteria laid out at the Montevideo Convention.

New York artist Patrick O’Connel would spend days visiting friends in the hospital, going to funerals, and coming home to a panicked answering machine message from friends who just learned they were sick. O’Connel and other artists banded together and started making art in response to AIDS. In 1988 they began calling their collective Visual AIDS.

And, he put a strap on it so that he could hang the device over his shoulder. Armed with his recorder (and sometimes a secret microphone attached to his wrist), Schwartz chronicled every sound in his Manhattan neighborhood.

The electricity from the affected line was diverted to another line. This was fairly normal and everything was fine—until a second bolt of lightening struck. Electric lines started shutting themselves off. As more and more lines were shut off, the system started to shut itself down. Eventually, the largest power generator in the area, known as Big Allis, turned itself off. And then all of New York City went dark. On that evening, DJ Grandmaster Caz, a Bronx native, was spinning records in a park. Caz recalls the evening: “The record just started slowing down, you know what I mean? So, quite naturally, we thought, it was us. We thought we had drained too much power and we shorted out the electricity. So we’re frantic, we’re looking around, we’re checking buttons, were checking switches, we’re seeing what’s up.” “It was chaos that night,” says Grandmaster Caz. “And it was exciting afterwards. But while it was going on, it was scary.” But Caz also believes that the the 1977 blackout may have accelerated the burgeoning Hip Hop movement. His theory: the looting that occurred during the blackout enabled people who couldn’t afford turntables and mixers to become DJs.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/adznzJp0wtY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\">"},{"type":"episode","id":122375772,"slug":"135-for-amusement-only","explicit":false,"mediaType":"audio/mpeg","title":"135- For Amusement Only","minimalTitle":"For Amusement Only","url":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/0l7xh7G7BZk/135-For-Amusement-Only.mp3","home":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~3/90a0VuMyJr0/","publishedAt":1412723825,"lookup":"https://player.fm/series/116582/122375772.json","share":"https://player.fm/1ZCcZN","size":14534284,"duration":1051,"description":"Everyone has tried it at some point.

Buildings and structures get added and renovated and removed, and in this process, bits and pieces that get left behind. Vestiges. Just as humans have tailbones and whales have pelvic bones, cities have doors that open into a limb-breaking drop, segments of fences that anyone can walk around, and pipes that carry nothing at all. Most of the time, these architectural leftovers rust or crumble or get taken down. But other times, these vestiges aren’t removed. They remain in the urban organism. And sometimes—even though they no longer serve any discernible purpose—they’re actually maintained. They get cleaned and polished and re-painted just because they’re there. These urban vestiges first caught the attention of an artist in Japan named Akasegawa Genpei. One day, in 1972, he was walking to lunch, and he came across a staircase that went up and then back down but had no door at the top. Then Akasegawa noticed that a piece of the railing that had been recently fixed. That’s when something clicked. Akasegawa started noticing similar urban leftovers, and treasured them as artistic byproducts of the city. He photographed all the things he could find that were both vestigial and maintained. He began publishing his findings in a magazine column, accompanied by musings about each object. People began to send Akasegawa pictures of similar architectural leftovers that they found, and in his column, Akasegawa would judge all submissions on two criteria: 1. Were they truly, completely useless? 2. Were they regularly maintained? In 1985 Akasegawa published a book of these collected photographs and writings, in which he coined a term for these kinds of urban leftovers. He called them, “Thomassons.”<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/1JvMi4NH7NU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\">"},{"type":"episode","id":122375779,"slug":"128-hacking-ikea","explicit":false,"mediaType":"audio/mpeg","title":"128- Hacking IKEA","minimalTitle":"Hacking IKEA","url":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/9t4gdo2odGQ/128-Hacking-IKEA.mp3","home":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~3/nKvtKMgb2O0/","publishedAt":1408484801,"lookup":"https://player.fm/series/116582/122375779.json","share":"https://player.fm/1ZCcZV","size":19619170,"duration":1369,"description":"IKEA hacking is the practice of buying things from IKEA and reengineering—or “hacking”—them to become customized, more functional, and often just better designed stuff.

For city officials, train graffiti was a sign that they had lost control. So, starting in the early 70s, mayors of New York vowed to eradicate graffiti. First, Mayor John Lindsey formed the first anti-graffiti task force. He also re-classified graffiti from a nuisance, like littering or loitering, into a crime. In 1984 David Gunn became President of the New York City Transit Authority. Systemically, train line by train line, Gunn took the subways off the map for graffiti writers. While they were fixing it, they didn’t allow any graffiti on it. If graffiti artists “bombed” a train car, the MTA pulled it from the system. Even during rush hour. May 12, 1989 was declared the official day of the city’s victory over train graffiti. But of course train graffiti has never stopped. There is still subway graffiti—it just never leaves the train yards.

There’s a bus depot, a ferry terminal, and a steady stream of cars. But in the late 19th early 20th centuries, this was cow country. Cows used to be ferried across the Hudson River from New Jersey, herded across Twelfth Avenue (now the West Side Highway), and brought to this part of town to be made into beef. You’ve heard of the meat packing district. This was like the meat hacking district. It was nicknamed “Abattoir Place.” It was a hive of bone boilers and hide stretchers and lard renderers. There was a disassembly line for every single part of a cow. As more and more cows were ferried to the slaughterhouses in Manhattan, it became impossible for passing herds to to coexist with Twelfth Avenue traffic. Not only did the number of cows increase, but so too had the number of carriages, and trains, and, eventually, cars. Cows were in the way. There were reports of epic cow jams on Twelfth avenue. That’s why people invented cow tunnels. Or at least the story of cow tunnels. At one point there might have actually been tunnels made expressly for cows to march underneath Twelfth Avenue to the abattoir. Or people might have just invented this crazy story about cow tunnels because everybody loves a good, vaguely plausible urban myth.

There are very few ways for players to put their own personal style into their uniforms. In baseball, in the face of huge opposition from curved-brim loyalists, some players take the bold stance of wearing a straight brim, like George Sherrill who is nick-named “The Brim Reaper” for his flat-brimmed style.

Today only about a mile is left standing. Compared with other famous walls in history, this wall had a pretty short life span. The Great Wall of China has been around for 2500 years. So have the walls of ancient Babylon—although its most famous part, the Ishtar Gate, is actually in a museum in Berlin. But even though the wall dividing Berlin into East and West was only up for 30 years, it had a huge impact on the psyche of the city. It broke families in two. In the decade that followed, more than 2 million people fled from east to west. East Germany was losing its most skilled workers as they sought jobs–and to reunite with their families–across the border. And East Germany was losing face with every East Berliner who chose to defect. And that’s why, in 1961, East Germany closed its border to West Berlin with a wall. But this isn’t a story about the design of the Berlin Wall. This is a story about one design to get through it—or really, underneath it.

Pittsburgh-based comedian Tom Muisal does a bit about a GPS unit that can give directions in “Pittsburghese.” Because in Pittsburgh, no one calls it “Interstate 376,” it’s “The Parkway.” It’s not “The Liberty Tunnel,” it’s “The Liberty Tubes.” And directions are often given by way of what used to be there. One day Tom was trying this routine out on his friend, Mike Neilson. Mike is not from Pittsburgh–he grew up on the other side of the state. When he moved to the Steel City, he had a hard time figuring out how to get around. Because Pittsburghers are always telling him to turn left at something that isn’t there anymore. And then, as Mike was listening to Tom’s Pittsburgher GPS routine, he noticed that in in one iteration of the joke he said, “turn left at the place that used to be a Pizza Hut.” This resonated with Mike. He realized that, because the architecture of a Pizza Hut is so distinctive, he could easily identify any building that used to be a Pizza Hut. The former Pizza Hut was thus a beacon of light shining through a thick fog of impossible directions. Here, in his friend’s comedy routine, was the one Pittsburghese direction he could give that anyone, regardless of where they’re from, could comprehend: turn left at the place that used to be a Pizza Hut. And from there, Mike created a global atlas of all the places that used to be Pizza Huts.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/28mKooa57Yk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\">"},{"type":"episode","id":122375805,"slug":"102-icon-for-access","explicit":false,"mediaType":"audio/mpeg","title":"102- Icon for Access","minimalTitle":"Icon for Access","url":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/dZgLi-RvSNU/102-Icon-for-Access.mp3","home":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~3/yoa_rE7UrFs/","publishedAt":1392755089,"lookup":"https://player.fm/series/116582/122375805.json","share":"https://player.fm/1ZCcZx","size":16133793,"duration":1151,"description":"There is a beauty to a universal standard. The idea that people across the world can agree that when they interact with one specific thing, everyone will be on the same page– regardless of language or culture or geographic locale. If you’re in Belgrade or Shanghai or São Paulo, you can look at a sign and know instantly, without speaking a word of the local language, that this floor is slippery. That the emergency exit is over there. That that substance is poisonous, and you should not eat it. The group behind those internationally recognized logos is called the International Organization for Standardization. One of the most recognizable ISO symbols in the International Symbol of Access. You might not know it by that name, but you’ve seen it. The International Symbol of Access is everywhere–on parking spaces, on buttons that operate automatic doors, in bathrooms, on seats on the bus or at movie theaters. Anywhere there’s an indication of special accommodations made for people with disabilities. The logo was created through a design contest in 1968, coordinated by an organization now called Rehabilitation International. The logo would have to be readily identifiable from reasonable distance, self-descriptive, simple, unambiguous, and practical. The winner was a Danish designer named Susanne Koefed–though her original design didn’t have a head! As the logo got absorbed into the built environment, and the politics of (dis)ability became more nuanced, some people started finding it a little lacking. So one group, the Accessible Icon Project, has created a new logo that they hope will ultimately replace ISO standard.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/yoa_rE7UrFs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\">"},{"type":"episode","id":122375806,"slug":"101-cover-story","explicit":false,"mediaType":"audio/mpeg","title":"101- Cover Story","minimalTitle":"Cover Story","url":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/U1sChG3NG-w/101-Cover-Story.mp3","home":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~3/Uzx1DVH070M/","publishedAt":1392143260,"lookup":"https://player.fm/series/116582/122375806.json","share":"https://player.fm/1ZCcZy","size":19556057,"duration":1365,"description":"You know the saying: you can’t judge a book by its cover.

They were business partners. Van Alen was considered the artistic maverick and Severance was the savvy businessman. It’s unclear why they broke up, but at some point, Severance decided he could do better on his own. The two parted ways and set up separate practices. At the time of their breakup, New York City was undergoing a boom like nothing ever seen before. Massive wealth turned Manhattan into some of the most valuable property in human history. And when property gets valuable, we build up. Late in 1928 Walter Chrysler, founder of the Chrysler car company, came to New York and bought a plot of land and decided to build, what he referred to as, “a monument to me.” Van Alen had already been working on plans for the previous owner of that plot and Chrysler decided to hire him to develop that plan into what would become the Chrysler Building. Walter Chrysler was a great fan of art and architecture and felt a real kinship with the Beaux-Arts trained William Van Alen. Meanwhile, downtown at 40 Wall Street, Craig Severance was planning the Manhattan Company Building. It was funded primarily by the young, Wall Street hot shot, George Ohrstrom. The two towers had different goals. Severance’s building was being constructed to make money. The Chrysler Building was intended to be a monument to Chrysler, but it also aimed to be a beautiful and innovative structure. At the time, Cass Gilbert’s Woolworth building was the tallest building in New York City and both Van Alen and Severance intended to take its crown. What followed was an epic back and forth struggle for the glory of ruling the New York City skyline.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/Vvdzmb_FpsM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\">"},{"type":"episode","id":122375808,"slug":"99-the-view-from-the-79th-floor","explicit":false,"mediaType":"audio/mpeg","title":"99- The View From The 79th Floor","minimalTitle":"The View From The 79th Floor","url":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/g_2ulXfgunI/99-The-View-From-The-79th-Floor.mp3","home":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~3/Z5VsX5JRftM/","publishedAt":1389767699,"lookup":"https://player.fm/series/116582/122375808.json","share":"https://player.fm/1ZCcaA","size":16090773,"duration":1149,"description":"On July 28, 1945, an airplane crashed into the Empire State Building. A B-25 bomber was flying a routine mission, chartering servicemen from Massachusetts to New York City. Capt. William F. Smith, who had led some of the most dangerous missions in World War II in the European theatre, was the pilot. The day was foggy. Smith called LaGuardia Airport and requested a clearance to land. With nearly zero visibility, the tower suggested that Smith stay in the air. He ignored air traffic control and started a descent that took him over midtown Manhattan. Just as he straightened out, the clouds broke up enough for him to realize he was flying among skyscrapers. The bomber crashed into the Empire State Building, the tallest building in the world at the time. The collision killed Smith, two others on the plane, and eleven people who worked inside the building. When the plane hit, parts of the engine flew ahead and severed the lifting cables of two elevators on the 79th floor. The elevators crashed to the sub-basement. In one of the elevators was a 19-year-old elevator operator named Betty Lou Oliver. She broke her pelvis, back and neck — but she survived.

They would have to be. Because it is in our nature to rise. History is full of things that lift other things. In ancient Greece, and China, and Hungary, there were systems of weights and pulleys and platforms designed to bring nobility–or their meals–to new heights. And somewhere below were draft animals, or even people, tasked with turning a wheel to bring these early elevators up and down. One man even spent the year of 1743 in a chimney in order to turn a lever to raise King Louis XV on a platform so the king wouldn’t have to walk up a single flight of stairs. These elevators were dangerous. Ropes would snap, and then anything getting raised or lowered would plummet to the ground. Fall one story and you break your leg–fall two stories you break your neck. And this fear of falling kept building heights low. People only wanted to ascend as high as they could walk. The tallest buildings for most of the 19th century were churches, or lighthouses–buildings made up primarily of empty space. And then came Elisha Otis.

Every thirteen-year-old in the area had their bar mitzvah there. Then, slowly, over time, it became Lincolnwood’s most infamous building. Changed hands, got seedy and run down. It was the home of the Midwest Fetish Fair and Marketplace convention. There were drug-fueled sex parties attended by shady Chicago politicians later convicted of things like extortion. And of course there was the convicted mobster Alan Dorfman, who was gunned down in the parking lot. It’s now dilapidated and empty. But even if you know nothing about the history, everyone in the area knows this hotel. Because it’s purple. Really, really purple.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/zOAyLpo5J7o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\">"},{"type":"episode","id":122375820,"slug":"89-bubble-houses","explicit":false,"mediaType":"audio/mpeg","title":"89- Bubble Houses","minimalTitle":"Bubble Houses","url":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/xWqmWXi-kqo/89-Bubble-Houses.mp3","home":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~3/RJH7Tzhgl50/","publishedAt":1379402269,"lookup":"https://player.fm/series/116582/122375820.json","share":"https://player.fm/1ZCcaN","size":24338347,"duration":1664,"description":"If you were a movie star in the market for a mansion in 1930s Los Angeles, there was a good chance you might call on Wallace Neff. Neff wasn’t just an architect–he was a starchitect. One of his most famous projects was the renovation of Pickfair, the estate owned by the iconic silent film actress Mary Pickford, and her husband Douglas Fairbanks. When the couple moved into Pickfar, the house sat on a nameless street in an empty neighborhood called Beverly Hills. If you were lucky enough to be invited to dinner at Pickfair you might find yourself seated next to Babe Ruth, the King of Spain or Albert Einstein. Life magazine called Pickfair “only slightly less important than the white house, and much more fun.” Neff designed estates for Charlie Chaplin, Judy Garland and Groucho Marx. His Libby Ranch is now owned by Reese Witherspoon. But at the end of his life, Wallace Neff lived in a 1,000 square foot concrete bubble. And Neff believed that this simple dome was his greatest architectural achievements. Los Angeles-based reporter David Weinberg spoke with historian Jeffrey Head, author of No Nails, No Lumber: The Bubble Houses of Wallace Neff. David also spoke with Kathy Miles, who grew up in Igloo Village; Steve Roden, an artist and current resident of the last remaining bubble house in the US; and architect Stefanos Polyzoides, who has his practice in a classic Spanish/Mediterranean-style Wallace Neff building. We also hear from Dakar-based producer Juliana Friend, who was nice enough to go check on the bubbles over there. A different version of this story originally aired on KCRW as part of their Independent Producer Project.

If nothing else because there are very few things that invoke a fear of being skewered. My preoccupation with metal reinforcement bars dovetails nicely with a structure in San Francisco I’ve kind of become obsessed with– a tiny bridge on the eastern edge of Golden Gate Park called the Alvord Lake Bridge. Ernest Ransome, the father of modern rebar, constructed the bridge in 1889. Today, it is a dumpy, cracked and neglected structure. The inside is a surreal tunnel of phony stalactites. But the Alvord Lake Bridge is, quite literally, the bridge to the modern world. It is one the oldest reinforced concrete structures still standing. The twisted iron bars embedded in the bridge served as the model for the all the rebar containing structures that followed. It is the ancestor to an endless number of reinforced concrete buildings, bridges, tunnels, viaducts, and foundations. Ransome major innovation in rebar was to twist the square bar so that it bonded to the concrete better. Concrete has incredible compression strength, but it does not have much tensile strength. So if you want concrete to span any significant distance, you need to embed metal reinforcement. Thanks to CCA Senior Adjunct Professor of Architecture, William Littman (he of the Forgotten Monument) for first telling me about the Alvord Lake Bridge and showing me around.

Journalists have an ethics code. Architects do, too. According to Ethical Standard 1.4 of the American Institute of Architects (AIA): “Members should uphold human rights in all their professional endeavors.” A group called Architects, Designers, and Planners for Social Responsibility (ADPSR) has taken the stance that there are some buildings that just should not have been built. Buildings that, by design, violate standards of human rights. Specifically, this refers to prisons with execution chambers, or prisons that are designed keep people in long-term isolation (or as prison officials call it, “segregation”). The latter kind of prison is called a “supermax,” or “security housing unit” (SHU). There is no legal definition for solitary confinement, so it’s up for debate as to whether the SHU constitutes solitary confinement. There has been a lot of controversy surrounding one SHU at a Northern California prison called Pelican Bay. Life inside of the SHU at Pelican Bay means 22 to 23 hours a day inside of 7.5 by 12 foot room. It’s not a space that’s designed to keep you comfortable. But it’s not just these architectural features, that concern humanitarian activists and psychiatrists. It’s the amount of time many prisoners spend in that cells, alone, without any meaningful activity. Some psychiatrists, such as Terry Kupers, say there is a whole litany of effects that a SHU can have on a person: massive anxiety, paranoia, depression, concentration and memory problems, and loss of ability to control one’s anger (which can get a prisoner in trouble and lengthen the SHU sentence). In California, SHU inmates are 33 times more likely to commit suicide than other prisoners incarcerated elsewhere in the state. There are even reports of eye damage due to the restriction on distance viewing. Terry Kupers says that a SHU “destroys people as human beings.” Compared with some other prisons in the California system, the Pelican Bay SHU has some redeeming architectural features. Inmates can get natural light from skylights outside of their cells, which drifts in through doors made of a perforated metal. These porous doors also allow for inmates to communicate with each other, even though there are no lines of sight to any prisoner from within the cell. But on the other hand, cells don’t have windows. Inmates never get to see the horizon. The only times prisoners get to leave the cell is to visit the shower, or the exercise yard–which is an empty, windowless room not that much bigger than a cell, with twenty-foot high concrete walls. Again, there is no universally accepted definition of solitary confinement. But some groups, like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have gone beyond calling the SHU solitary confinement–they call it torture. In 2011, the UN Special Rapporteur on torture said anything over 15 days in solitary confinement is a human rights abuse–which other sources have interpreted as torture. So if it is the ethical code of architects to promote human rights…what is their responsibility to the people who … <a href=\"http://99percentinvisible.prx.org/2013/05/28/80-an-architects-code/\">Continue reading <span>?</span></a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/_YyC06ot0_U\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\">"},{"type":"episode","id":122375830,"slug":"79-the-symphony-of-sirens-plus-soviet-design","explicit":false,"mediaType":"audio/mpeg","title":"79- The Symphony of Sirens plus Soviet Design","minimalTitle":"The Symphony of Sirens plus Soviet Design","url":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/YdUfbniLD_Y/79-Symphony-of-Sirens-Revisited-plus-Soviet-Design.mp3","home":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~3/02ahSBCQHak/","publishedAt":1368052213,"lookup":"https://player.fm/series/116582/122375830.json","share":"https://player.fm/1ZCcaY","size":23629102,"duration":1618,"description":"For the ancient Greeks, sirens were mythical creatures who sang out to passing sailors from rocks in the sea. Their music was so beautiful, it was said, that the sailors were powerless against it–they would turn their ships towards these sea nymphs and crash in the impassable reefs around them. In Homer’s Odyssey, there’s a story where Odysseus and his men are traveling near an area that Sirens are known to inhabit. Odysseus knows that if he hears the siren’s song, his ship is going to sink. But he still wants to hear what they sound like. So he comes up with a plan: Odysseus has his men tie him to the mast of his ship so that he can’t give commands. And then Odysseus has his men fill their own ears with beeswax so they can’t hear anything. They set sail in striking distance of the sirens’ call. The plan works: Odysseus gets to hear the music, his men don’t, and they sail on to safety–with Odysseus pleading with his crew to crash the boat the whole way. And for the next 2000 or so years, that’s what a siren was: a creature that makes a beautiful sound. But that all changed in 1819, when a French engineer named Charles Cagniard de la Tour decided to call the artificial noisemaker he was working on–the siren. And this new, mechanical siren became one of THE signature sounds of the turn of the Century. Sirens warned people about immanent bombing raids during World War I. Sirens announced incoming fire engines, and ambulances, and police. Thanks in part to the siren, the world of the the early 20th Century had become a lot louder than any time in human history. And we can probably assume that these sirens that people heard in cities all over the world–sounded NOTHING like the siren songs of Greek myth. At least to most. One man, a composer, named Arseny Avraamov heard music in the cacophony of the modern world. And he tried to create a composition–a symphony– from the clatter of the newly formed Soviet Union. Moscow-based producer Charles Maynes investigated the legend of Avraamov and his forgotten masterpiece. This is The Symphony of Sirens, Revisited.

To circumvent anti-gambling laws in the US, early slot machines masqueraded as vending machines. They gave out chewing gum as prizes, and those prizes could be redeemed for cash. That’s where the fruit logos come from. In fact, in the UK, slot machines are called “fruit machines.” Despite outward appearances, slot machines have evolved dramatically since they first appeared in 1895. To play the first slot machines, you slipped in a coin and pulled the lever to set the machine’s wheels in motion. The slot machine’s crank-action operation (and the way it took your money) earned it the nickname of the “one-armed bandit.” But today, those hand-crank levers are uncommon, and where they do exist they are known as “legacy levers,” because they have zero relation to how the machine actually works. Everything inside a slot machine has been computerized and automated–from how you enter money, to how you bet, to how you play, to how you win and lose, and even to how you feel when leave. At first, gambling machines existed at the fringes of casino culture–both figuratively and literally. The real money was in tabletop games–or so it was thought–and the slots were set up around the edges of the casino to give gamblers’ wives something to do while they waited. But then video technology expanded what slots could do. Now a machine could have more rows and columns than the standard three-by-three, and allowed you to place multiple bets on a single spin. A penny slot machine could let you place a hundred different one-cent bets per spin–so even if you win 40 cents on one line, and the machine congratulates you with flashing lights and chimes, you still lose 60 cents. And that’s how video slots have become the most lucrative–and addictive–game in a casino. Our guest this week is Natasha Dow Schüll, an MIT-based anthropologist who has been studying Las Vegas and the culture of gambling for more than fifteen years.

And most of all, it’s good design. But it’s not the way basketball was originally designed. During pro basketball’s infancy in the 1950s, nothing forced a player to shoot the ball. If a team was winning, and they wanted to keep their lead, the team could literally hold on to the ball for ten minutes and run the clock out.

Responsible parents would tell their children, “Go outside, and play in the streets. All day.” And then the automobile happened. And then automobiles began killing thousands of children, every year. Many viewed the car as a death machine. One newspaper cartoon even compared the car to Moloch, the god to whom the Ammonites supposedly sacrificed their children. At first, pedestrian deaths were considered public tragedies. Parades were held in dozens of cities to commemorate the dead children. Cities built monuments. Mothers of children killed in the streets are given a special White Star to honor their loss. The main cause for these deaths was that the rules of the street were vastly different than they are today. A street functioned like a city park, or a pedestrian mall, where you could move in any direction without really thinking about it. The only moving hazards were animals and other people.

Some lived an itinerant lifestyle, traveling from town to town, knocking on the doors of local shops, asking if they could paint their signs. This was the way things were until as recently as the 1980s, when everything was upended by the vinyl plotter. Now, sign-making was faster, easier, and cheaper than ever before. Moreover, vinyl signs didn’t require any skill to make. But over time, they created an environment of anonymity and impermanence. Hand painted signs began to disappear. But not completely.

Santiago, the capital of Chile, has been going through a tremendous growth spurt since its economic boom of the mid 1990s. It happened fast. In just a few years, single family homes all over the city were replaced with high rises. A man named Rodrigo Rojas played a small part in Santiago’s “upward mobility”–which wouldn’t be that remarkable if he were an engineer, a real estate developer, or an architect. But Rodrigo Rojas is a poet. This is how it worked: A developer bought an old house, tore it down, and had an architect draw up plans for a high rise. And then Rodrigo stepped in to give the building a name. Rodrigo even fabricated whole stories in the service of building an identity. He came up with one story about a ship called the Zanzibar, a luxury liner built with the Titanic, but slightly smaller. You’ve never heard of it, he explained, because the Zanzibar never sank.

The buildings are beautiful–but they are not original. During World War II, Nazi forces razed more than 80% of Warsaw. After Soviet troops took over, much of the city was rebuilt in the with communist style: fast, cheap, and big. They built apartment blocks, wide avenues, and heavy grey buildings. It was communist ideology in architectural form. But when it came to the historic district of Warsaw– the Old Town and a long connecting section called the Royal Route–they decided not just to rebuild, but to restore. Builders would use the same stones, and use special kilns to make special bricks to preserve its authenticity. After six years of reconstruction, the new Old Town was opened. Poles were ecstatic to have it back. Even in the West, it was seen as a triumph of the human spirit. But here’s the thing: Warsaw’s historic Old Town is not a replica of the original. It’s a re-imagining. An historic city that never really was.

One was buying geodes and smashing them apart with a hammer. (You know geodes, right? Those dull-looking brown rocks that you break open to reveal crystalline structures inside?) One day, when Melissa was thirteen, she and her friend Liz bought some geodes. They didn’t want to wait to get home to crack them open, so they decided to throw them against the wall of an apartment building. Liz’s aim went wild, and the geode went through a window. Melissa and Liz tried to find person whose window they had broken, but they couldn’t figure out which door in the apartment building lead to the unit with the window in question. Eventually they gave up. Melissa would have probably forgotten about the incident had it not been for one inexplicable thing: the window didn’t get fixed. Ever. It was clear that someone lived there. Melissa would walk by the window and see the apartment lit up by a TV. Someone was opening the window in the summer, and closing it in the winter. But the hole remained. Melissa finished middle school, then high school, then went away to college. And when she came home and saw the window still broken, it had this effect of making her feel like the nervous, insecure thirteen year old she was when she broke the window. This became a pattern for Melissa: she’d leave home, do some growing up, come home, see the window, and feel like a teenager. Melissa traveled the world. She went to graduate school, She moved to Washington, DC, She got married. And every time she’d come home, she’d see the window. “As much as I was changing, this part of my past was completely frozen,” Melissa says. “As soon as I saw the window I was brought right back to those middle school days when we had broken it.” So in 2011, 22 years after the incident, Melissa went to go find the person who left the window broken for so long.

By its peak in the 1990s, the 6.5 acre Kowloon Walled City was home to at least 33,000 people (with estimates of up to 50,000). That’s a population density of at least 3.2 million per square mile. For New York City to get that dense, every man, woman, and child living in Texas would have to move to Manhattan. To put it another way, think about living in a 1,200 square foot home. Then imagine yourself living with 9 other people. Then imagine that your building is only one unit of a twelve-story building, and every other unit is as full as yours. Then imagine hundreds those buildings crammed together in a space the size of four football fields. We can’t really imagine it, either. Kowloon Walled City began as a military fort in Kowloon, a region in mainland China. In 1898, China signed a land lease with Great Britain, giving the British control of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and other nearby territories. But the lease stipulated that the fort in Kowloon would remain under Chinese jurisdiction. Over time, the fort became abandoned, leaving the area subject to neither Chinese nor British authority. This legal gray zone was attractive to displaced and marginalized people. Thousands of people moved there after the war with Japan broke out. Even more people moved there after the Communist Revolution. It attracted gangsters, drug addicts, sex workers, and refugees. And it also drew a lot of normal people from all over China who saw opportunity there. They built the city building by building, first blanketing the area of the fort, then building vertically. Buildings were packed together so tightly in the Walled City that the alleys were nearly pitch-black in the day time. Electricity and water were brought in by illegal or informal means. The Walled City gained a reputation as a sort of den of iniquity–there were high levels of prostitution, gambling, mafia activity, and, for some reason, rampant unlicensed dentistry. But an order did emerge. The Walled City had no schools, but there was an informal kindergarten. A resident’s organization settled disputes. And there was lots of industry: a fishball factory, a noodle factory, metalworking shops, a textile mill. There were stores, restaurants. You could even receive mail in the Walled City. Kowloon Walled City was torn down in 1993. Today, it’s a park, and most traces of the city are gone. But the memory of the city lives on. It was featured in the non-verbal film Baraka, plays a cameo role in Bloodsport. It’s also served as the setting in a number of video games, including most recently Call of Duty: Black Ops This week’s episode was produced by Nick van der Kolk.

It has long been hypothesized that stripes on zebras make it difficult for a predator to distinguish one zebra from another when the zebras are in a large herd. The stripes also might make zebras less attractive to blood sucking horseflies. This is called disruptive camouflage. When it comes to humans, the greatest, most jaw-droppingly spectacular application of disruptive camouflage was called Dazzle. Dazzle painting emerged in the 1910s as design solution to a very dire problem: American and British ships were being sunk left and right by German U-Boats. England needed to import supplies to fight the Central Powers, and these ships were sitting ducks in the Atlantic Ocean. They needed a way to fend of the torpedoes. Conventional high-similarity camouflage just doesn’t work in the open sea. Conditions like the color of the sky, cloud cover, and wave height change all the time, not to mention the fact that there’s no way to hid all the smoke left by the ships’ smoke stacks. The strategy of this high-difference, dazzle camouflage was not about invisibility. It was about disruption. Confusion. Torpedoes in the Great War could only be fired line-of-sight, so instead of firing at where they saw the ship was at that moment, torpedo gunners would have to chart out where the ship would be by the time the torpedo got there. They had to determine the target ship’s speed and direction with just a brief look through the periscope. The torpedo gunner’s margin of error for hitting a ship was quite low. Dazzle painting could throw off an experienced submariner by as much as 55 degrees. Our expert this week is Roy Behrens, a professor graphic design at the University of Northern Iowa. He’s published several books about camouflage, and also runs the Camoupedia blog.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/Ke5Sc_eJf7Q\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\">"},{"type":"episode","id":122375845,"slug":"99-invisible-64-derelict-dome","explicit":false,"mediaType":"audio/mpeg","title":"99% Invisible-64- Derelict Dome","url":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/9c8DyhfB_4A/64-Derelict-Dome.mp3","home":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~3/zy4HfyNplJs/","publishedAt":1351207594,"lookup":"https://player.fm/series/116582/122375845.json","share":"https://player.fm/1ZCcap","size":14104198,"duration":1024,"description":"In the Cape Cod town of Woods Hole, buildings are not usually dome-shaped. Producer Katie Klocksin was pretty surprised when she came across one. Katie started asking around about the dome. She found it was built by the late Buckminster Fuller, who called himself a “comprehensive anticipatory design scientist,” out to solve the problems confronting “Starship Earth” by changing the way we make buildings. “Bucky” Fuller invented and patented the geodesic dome, a spherical structure made from small triangles. The design is based on a lot of complicated math, but the idea is that by relying on the strength of of the triangle, these buildings could be made from cheaper materials, like plastic and aluminum instead of steel and concrete. In 1953, Fuller was commissioned to build a dome in Woods Hole by architect (and aspiring restauranteur) Gunnar Peterson. The dome would become the posh Dome Restaurant. Diners could gaze through the building’s triangular windows out on onto the sea. A zither player named Ruth Welcome entertained guests. Despite its Utopian aspirations, the building had some structural problems. The glass windows heated the restaurant up like a greenhouse, so the owner installed fiberglass over most of the dome, blocking the ocean views. It leaked constantly, and was difficult to maintain. Even though the Woods Hole dome did not radically change the world, Bucky Fuller would go on to become one of the most influential thinkers in design and architecture of the 20th Century. Today, the Dome Restaurant lies vacant. A new development project could lead to the dome’s restoration, but for now, it remains a decaying curiosity, inviting exploration from microphone-wielding out-of-towners.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/zy4HfyNplJs\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\">"},{"type":"episode","id":122375846,"slug":"99-invisible-63-the-political-stage","explicit":false,"mediaType":"audio/mpeg","title":"99% Invisible-63- The Political Stage","url":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/WOObh95Md1Q/63-The-Political-Stage.mp3","home":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~3/lfD4B-8QRG0/","publishedAt":1350077577,"lookup":"https://player.fm/series/116582/122375846.json","share":"https://player.fm/1ZCcaq","size":14770431,"duration":1066,"description":"On this special edition of 99% Invisible, we joined forces with Andrea Seabrook of DecodeDC to investigate all the thought that goes into the most miniscule details of a political campaign.

Comcast has taken the lead in providing high-speed internet to consumers, but people like the CEO of Netflix have been critical of Comcast favoring its own video content over video from third party services such as Netflix and HBO Go.

For many cities, the pneumatic tube was essential in getting these slips of paper to the intended recipient quickly. It’s no surprise that electronic communication eventually killed most of the need for pneumatic tubes. But you may not know that it was the telegraph itself that also put pneumatic tubes into widespread use. Architectural historian and pneumatic tube aficionada Molly Wright Steenson leads us through the rise and fall (but not disappearance of) pneumatic tubes in Paris, and beyond.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/NQm2V2DhQdQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\">"},{"type":"episode","id":122375849,"slug":"99-invisible-60b-backstory-heyward-shepherd-memorial","explicit":false,"mediaType":"audio/mpeg","title":"99% Invisible-60b- BackStory- Heyward Shepherd Memorial","url":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/J-vRqYWAA10/60b-BackStory-Shepherd-Memorial.mp3","home":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~3/SbI6frk3ip4/","publishedAt":1347297350,"lookup":"https://player.fm/series/116582/122375849.json","share":"https://player.fm/1ZCcat","size":12289017,"duration":911,"description":"I only recently started listening to BackStory with the American History Guys, but it’s already earned a top spot in my crowded weekly rotation.

Still, embedded in the architecture of a 25 year old plaza were the words of Walt Whitman and Frank O’Hara. And weirdly, Sean had he’d been reciting from O’Hara’s Lunch Poems just minutes before.

It was swank! Roberta Flack stayed there. Barry Mannilow stayed there. Perry Como. Michael Jordon stayed there on his first night in Chicago. Every thirteen year old boy in the area had his bar mitzvah there. Then, slowly, over time, it became Lincolnwood’s most infamous building. Changed hands, got seedy and run down. It was the home of the Midwest Fetish Fair and Marketplace convention. There were drug-fueled sex parties attended by shady Chicago politicians later convicted of things like extortion. And of course there was the convicted mobster Alan Dorfman, who was gunned down in the parking lot. It’s now dilapidated and empty. But even if you know nothing about the history, everyone in the area knows this hotel. Because it’s purple. Really, really purple.

Of course that was before audio recording, so now, for the most part, music is frozen music. It’s only very recently in the history of music that we’ve been able to freeze music into an object. In my life, the form of this object mattered a lot. I once bought vinyl albums and cassette tapes, where there were two first songs per album, Side A and Side B. The energy of a first song makes it stand apart, at least in my head it does. Then the CD came along and eliminated Side B and there was only first song, and the actual number of a track (that you see prominently on the UI) became my index for sorting songs. Then MP3s jumbled my sense of track order, and albums began to feel more like a loose grouping of individual pieces rather than a conceptual whole. I could name hundreds more examples like these, and I welcome you to chime in, but my point is: the form of the thing matters. But no effect has been as world changing as that original innovation: freezing music in time onto a recording, where a single version of a song, a single performance of a song, became the song. An inherently mutable method of communication was fundamentally changed. I heard a radio broadcast several years ago that really affected the way I thought about all this. Jim Derogatis and Greg Kot are the hosts of a radio program I’m a huge fan of called Sound Opinions (subscribe now). The songwriter, composer, and producer, Jon Brion came to WBEZ in Chicago to talk to Sound Opinions in 2006. At the time, Brion has just co-produced Kanye West’s album Late Registration and he was also already a renowned film composer. In this interview, Brion talks about the difference between what he calls “performance pieces” and “songs” and how recorded music has changed the way we appreciate the different art forms.

Belgians take beer very seriously. Amongst the 200 Belgian breweries, there’s a very specific sub-type: Trappist beers. According to our reporter Cyrus Farivar (also from Episode #36 “Super Bonn Bon”), there are two things you need to know about Trappist beers. First, they’re amazing. Second, they’re made by Trappist monks. These monks trace their roots to a monastery in 17th century France, and have since spread out to all over the world. The main concept behind the Trappist lifestyle is that the abbey should be economically self-sufficient. In other words, the monks should make something and sell it to the public as a way to fund the operations of the abbey itself. Some make cheese. Some make spirits. There’s even one in Germany that makes lentil soup. But none of the Trappist products are as famous as the beer. The beer that is considered the best of the best is Westvleteren 12. With its plain brown bottle, no label, the only writing is on the cap- the beer is super cool. It’s quite rare and year after year it’s rated the best beer in the world. But here’s the thing about Westvleteren. You can’t just go there and have as much beer as you want. You can’t even have it shipped from the abbey. If you want to buy beer to take with you, you have to look up the beer reservation phone number on the abbey’s website. Then, you call certain phone number during certain hours, on certain days. If you’re lucky enough to talk to a monk to take your reservation, you have to give your license plate number and be available to come pick up your crate during the appointed time that weekend. You’re limited to one crate per person per car, maximum two per car. And, you can’t buy more than one crate during a 60-day period. You also have to agree not to resell the beer. This sort of thing is not unheard of: velvet ropes and random reward have long been imposed to create artificial scarcity to heighten demand, but the mainstream trend today seems to be more geared toward greater access and accommodation for customers. The new ideal is that everything is available, at all times, no matter where you live. Yet the Westvleteren Trappists are trying to make it as difficult as possible. Jef van den Steen, author of a book called Trappist: The Seven Heavenly Beers and an acclaimed brewer himself, says that’s not the case, “Before, Westvleteren was only well-known was in Belgium. And now it’s worldwide, and that’s the problem. They decide we will brew the same amount as the last 40-50 years, and they have enough for that, so why must they brew more? Because you want? No. They live between the walls of the abbey, so for them it’s not a problem.” The “customer service” is not designed to … <a href=\"http://99percentinvisible.prx.org/2012/05/31/99-invisible-55-the-best-beer-in-the-world/\">Continue reading <span>?</span></a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/Y-auZc-lC_o\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\">"},{"type":"episode","id":122375858,"slug":"99-invisible-54-the-colour-of-money","explicit":false,"mediaType":"audio/mpeg","title":"99% Invisible-54- The Colour of Money","url":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/kCbkzcSptTQ/54-The-Colour-of-Money.mp3","home":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~3/1xQfG0ty9_E/","publishedAt":1337210501,"lookup":"https://player.fm/series/116582/122375858.json","share":"https://player.fm/1ZCcbC","size":16069822,"duration":1151,"description":"US paper currency is so ubiquitous that to really look at its graphic design with fresh eyes requires some deliberate and focused attention. So pull out a greenback from your wallet (or look at a picture one online) and just take really take it in. All the fonts, the busy filigree, the micro patterns…it’s just dreadful. Even though paper currency itself, just idea of money, is a massive, world changing technology, the look and feel of US paper money is very stagnant. Richard Smith is the founder of the Dollar ReDe$ign Project and in an article in the New York Times, he pointed out five major areas where the design of US currency could improve: color, size, functionality, composition, and symbolism. It just so happens that Australian currency addresses each and every one of the points made by Richard Smith. Tristan Cooke and Tom Nelson of the blog Humans in Design are big fans of all the design innovations in Australian money. Aussie polymer notes are varied in color, get larger with each denomination, are more durable and are generally considered better and easier to use than US currency. But there are some interesting reasons why the greenback is the way it is. David Wolman, author of The End of Money, explains that the legacy features that make US paper money look stale and anachronistic are meant to convey stability and timelessness. Since the US economy is so important in the world economy, why mess with it? Some fear that changing the design of the currency significantly (or eliminating the penny) could undermine the faith in the federal reserve note. Even though Tristan and Tom are fans of the Australian polymer bills, they share Wolman’s view that the more interesting future innovations are not going to have anything to do with physical cash. Clever user interfaces that help us manage our money better, while providing even greater convenience, are getting more refined and accepted.

Julia Barton remembers going to the top floor of Dallas’s then-new city hall when she was teenager. The building, designed by I.M. Pei, is a huge trapezoid jutting out over a wide plaza. Julia found the view from the top pretty fantastic, especially when munching on a Caramello bar from the City Hall vending machines. But once she went to a protest in the plaza below. And those same windows, now hulking over her, made her feel small, and the whole event insignificant. Texans have a fondness for big structures—big arenas, big houses, big freeways. Julia wasn’t sure if their hidden message wasn’t simply this: I’m important, you’re nobody. For people who distrust the big project, Edward Tenner’s 2001 essay “The Xanadu Effect” is some comfort. Tenner, a visiting scholar at Princeton University, ponders the ways in which obsession with bigness can presage hard times for a business or even a nation. Tenner named his essay not for Olivia Newton-John’s anthem or even the Coleridge poem, but for the palace Xanadu built in the movie “Citizen Kane.” That Xanadu, of course, was based on a real-life palace that newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst built in his waning days of empire: On its 24,000 acres were a 354,000-gallon swimming pool, a private zoo and four main buildings with a total of 165 rooms. Along with other such extravagances, the estate helped send Hearst into trusteeship late in life. The cavernous halls of Welles’ gloomy cinematic Xanadu seemed to filmgoers — as the real, happier building must have appeared to many Hearst Corp. public investors — the very image of the pride that goes before a fall. The downside of the Xanadu Effect has seen itself play out in other places—the Empire State Building, for example, was conceived in the 1920s but completed during the Great Depression, when it was known as “the Empty State Building.” Tenner’s not arguing that big things shouldn’t be built; he’s saying bigness is a gamble. It pays off when it it uplifts people, gives them a sense of grandeur and purpose. It fails when it crushes them or just makes life a pain, as in the big-built city of Moscow, where pedestrians have to scurry under the wide avenues in tunnels. On a recent reporting trip to Russia for PRI’s “The World,” Julia travelled to Sochi, Russia’s southern-most city and upcoming host of the 2014 Winter Olympics. Sochi is Europe’s biggest construction site right now, with Xanadu-like ice-palaces going up right on the Black Sea. All the construction—including billions of dollars of infrastructure—is good news for the Russian state and shoring up its presence in the Caucasus. It’s not necessarily good news for the locals. Julia interviewed a Sochi resident, Alexei Kravets, who’s been in a stand-off with authorities about the fate of the home he built by the Black Sea. Kravets’s court case to save his home has been standing in the way of a new railway … <a href=\"http://99percentinvisible.prx.org/2012/05/01/99-invisible-53-the-xanadu-effect/\">Continue reading <span>?</span></a><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/AgpZa4OKleM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\">"},{"type":"episode","id":122375860,"slug":"99-invisible-52-galloping-gertie","explicit":false,"mediaType":"audio/mpeg","title":"99% Invisible-52- Galloping Gertie","url":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/96VaXd0FOkc/52-Galloping-Gertie.mp3","home":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~3/Y74QcSIDuUA/","publishedAt":1334770521,"lookup":"https://player.fm/series/116582/122375860.json","share":"https://player.fm/1ZCcbE","size":12001395,"duration":897,"description":"Even during the construction of the original Tacoma Narrows Bridge, the deck would go up and down by several feet with the slightest breeze. Construction workers on the span chewed on lemon wedges to stop their motion sickness. They nicknamed the structure Galloping Gertie. The original Tacoma Narrows Bridge design by Clark Eldridge was pretty conventional for a suspension bridge, but it was later modified by Leon Moisseiff to be slimmer and more elegant. The most notable change was that the 25 foot lattice of stiffening trusses underneath the bridge on the original drawings, were replaced with 8 foot solid steel plate girders. The new solid girder along the side in Moisseiff’s design made for a much lighter and more flexible bridge— it also caught the wind like a sail— but they didn’t know that. Moisseiff’s design was also 2/3 the price of the original Eldridge design and that fact ultimately won the day. Motorists who used the bridge found out first hand why it got the name Galloping Gertie, and during the four months while the bridge was open, many traveled from far away just to ride the undulating waves as they crossed high above Puget Sound. The thrill ride didn’t last long. On November 7, 1940 stiff winds caused the road deck to twist violently along its center axis. The center span endured these brutal torsional forces for about an hour and finally gave way. The collapse of the twisting suspension bridge is one of the most dramatic images caught on film. I talked to John Marr from the seminal zine Murder Can Be Fun for this story and I’d like to give a shout out to Alan Bellows of Damn Interesting for independently suggesting Galloping Gertie as a show topic and publishing a great, much more detailed account of the disaster on his site.

Cities are great. They have movement, activity and diversity. But go to any city and it’s pretty clear, a place can be diverse without really being integrated. This segregation isn’t accidental. There are design elements in the urban landscape, that Daniel D’Oca calls “weapons,” that are used by “architects, planners, policy-makers, developers, real estate brokers, community activists, neighborhood associations, and individuals to wage the ongoing war between integration and segregation.” Daniel D’Oca is an urban planner with Interboro Partners, an architecture and design firm based in New York City.

But for designers at Gallaudet University in Washington, DC, it’s the absence of sound that defines the approach to architecture. Gallaudet is a university dedicated to educating the deaf and hard of hearing, and since 2005, they’ve re-thought principles of architecture with one question at the forefront: how do deaf people communicate in space? Unlike hearing people, the deaf have to keep sightlines in order to maintain conversations. So when deaf people walk and talk, they’ll lock into a kind of dance. Going through a doorway, one person will spin in place and walk backwards to keep talking. Walking past a column, two deaf people in conversation will move in tandem to avoid collision. Spaces designed for the hearing can also give the deaf a great deal of anxiety – when you can’t hear footsteps from around the corner or behind you, you can’t anticipate who or what is around you. Robert Sirvage is a deaf designer, researcher, and instructor at Gallaudet, and in collaboration with Hansel Bauman — who is not deaf – and a group of staff, students and architects, they’ve developed a project called DeafSpace. Reporter Tom Dreisbach took a tour through the new building at Gallaudet that is incorporating the innovations of DeafSpace to create an environment more pleasing to everyone, both hearing and deaf.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/mCulBWAdTqY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\">"},{"type":"episode","id":122375863,"slug":"99-invisible-49-queue-theory-and-design","explicit":false,"mediaType":"audio/mpeg","title":"99% Invisible-49- Queue Theory and Design","url":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/actkrz4a2AU/49-Queue-Theory-and-Design.mp3","home":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~3/920bGr37KUA/","publishedAt":1331263416,"lookup":"https://player.fm/series/116582/122375863.json","share":"https://player.fm/1ZCcbH","size":9537154,"duration":744,"description":"In the US, it’s called a line.

That’s when she found the marble bathtubs. The bathtubs were installed around 1860 during the expansion of the Capitol. DC is known for its swampy summers, and legend has it that senators could be banished from the chamber if they were too smelly. But lawmakers–like most Americans at the time–didn’t have indoor plumbing at home. They needed a place where they could wash up. So the Architect of the Capitol ordered six marble bath tubs, each three by seven feet and carved by hand in Italy, to be installed in the Capitol basement–three on the House side, three on the senate. Today, only two tubs remain on the Senate side, in a room which now stores the building’s heating and cooling equipment.

They were a luxury item. The invention of Vulcanite hard rubber changed everything. It was moldable, it could be precisely fitted, and it was relatively cheap. Everyone began making dentures with Vulcanite bases. But in 1864, a long disputed patent application, originally filed in 1852, was awarded and then acquired by the Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Company. It was an outfit created to collect fees, or very often, sue dentists who already used vulcanite, and there were plenty of dentists to go after. The person in charge of pursuing the violators was Josiah Bacon, the treasurer of the Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Company. The patent was enforced with extreme prejudice, despite the protestations of the US dental profession. To quote the secretary of the Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Company, Ernest Caduc: “Many dentists…relying upon the secret nature of the business, prefer to steal this property rather than buy it…” It all came to a head on Easter Sunday in 1879. A Vulcanite denture patent violating dentist named Samuel Chalfant went to settle his business with his pursuer, Josiah Bacon, in his San Francisco hotel room. Chalfant brought a gun.

It’s a design that kind of pulls you in and invites you to take the steps down to the water and climb in between the hulking stones. And that’s part of the problem.

The original shiny black cube, built in 1975, was referred to as the “Darth Vader building” by court employees (presumably after 1977). The foreboding and intimidating structure is primarily criticized in relation to its function as a family courthouse, which should strive to inspire a feeling of trust, authority, and (one hopes) inclusion. The building was remodeled in 2006. The bones are largely the same, but the shiny, black cladding is gone, replaced by a more conventional grey/beige. The problematic entrance to the building has been completely opened up, making ingress and egress a much less daunting proposition. To quote our 99% Invisible reporter this week, Brett Myers, “walking into the building is no longer like being consumed by a beast.” But a little something was lost in the facelift. The original building was definitely not boring and commanded your attention. I don’t know if the same can be said for the current design.

Ten years after the move, Bonn is finding its new identity and purpose, but hidden clues in the urban landscape remind us of the city it used to be. Cyrus Farivar takes us on a tour of his neighborhood in what used to be the diplomatic quarter of Bonn with local historian and tour guide Michael Wenzel. Farivar is the science and technology editor at Deutsche Welle English and the author of The Internet of Elsewhere – about the history and effects of the Internet on different countries around the world.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/cJ_bUQScbOo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\">"},{"type":"episode","id":122375878,"slug":"99-invisible-35-elegy-for-wtc","explicit":false,"mediaType":"audio/mpeg","title":"99% Invisible-35- Elegy for WTC","url":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/GzexTIAyM-g/35-Elegy-for-WTC.mp3","home":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~3/mc0lweUk_VQ/","publishedAt":1314918060,"lookup":"https://player.fm/series/116582/122375878.json","share":"https://player.fm/1ZCcbY","size":6132448,"duration":531,"description":"I want to be careful not to overstate what it means for a building to die.

This marking is called the load line, or as I prefer, the Plimsoll line. This simple graphic design has saved thousands of lives. The Plimsoll line shows the maximum loading point of the ship and lets a third party know, plainly and clearly, when a vessel is overloaded and at risk of sinking in rough seas. If you see that horizontal line above the water, you’re good, if you don’t, you could be sunk. The load line was named after the crusading British MP Samuel Plimsoll. The advent of insurance in the 19th century, created an incentive for ship owners to purposely sink their own ships and collect the insurance money. This grim practice became so widespread, and killed so many merchant seamen, that the over-insured, overloaded vessels became known as “coffin ships.” Samuel Plimsoll (“the sailors friend”) fought for sweeping merchant shipping regulation that led to the adoption of the marking that bears his name. Tristan Cooke, a human factors engineer and creator of a great blog called Humans in Design, tells us the history of the Plimsoll line and explains why it’s one of his favorite examples of design.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/UGWEZMqwoPI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\">"},{"type":"episode","id":122375881,"slug":"99-invisible-32-design-for-airports","explicit":false,"mediaType":"audio/mpeg","title":"99% Invisible-32- Design for Airports","url":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/O6mH9GbrlY4/32-Design-for-Airports.mp3","home":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~3/eU5Lh_QGPx4/","publishedAt":1311822637,"lookup":"https://player.fm/series/116582/122375881.json","share":"https://player.fm/1ZCcbb","size":7821009,"duration":637,"description":"When I spoke with Allison Arieff about the design of airports, she said to me, if all airports simply played Brian Eno’s album Ambient 1: Music for Airports over the speakers, every airport would be better.

He scoured the country, looking for a hospital with a management system worth adopting, but he never found one. Instead he ended up in Japan. At a Toyota factory. This entire, multiyear overhaul started with a ball of blue yarn. The staff met with a Toyota Production System sensei and he took out the ball of blue yarn and a map of the hospital and told the staff to trace the path a cancer patient would take on a typical visit for chemotherapy treatment. When they were finished, it was an immensely powerful visual experience for everyone in the room. They all stared at this map with blue yarn snaking all over the place, doubling back on itself and making complicated twists and turns from one end of the building to the other.

Cul-de-sacs by definition aren’t well connected to other streets and they are far away town centers. People can argue whether or not these are pros or cons, depending on what lifestyle choices they prioritize. For little kids, cul-de-sacs can be great, but they do have some real, quantifiable design flaws. Imagine being a garbage collector, or a street cleaner, instead of driving down one long street and collecting all the garbage from that street, then taking a right onto the next street and so on, you have to turn around in all of these cul-de-sacs over and over again. It takes more time and uses more gas. They’re expensive for governments to maintain, and now, governments are starting to enact regulations against them.

It’s a triangle-shaped skyscraper, 27 stories, with tall, super-narrow, irregularly-spaced windows up and down each wall. The outside walls look like old computer punchcards. As odd as it looks, each of these striking details serve a purpose. The architect, Harry Weese, made bold innovations that were solutions to practical problems. The triangular shape creates easy sight-lines for the guards inside. The windows are narrow (5 inches) to prevent escapes (without requiring bars), but beveled out, to funnel natural light inside. The interior design was very thoughtfully considered as well. As stunning as it is, the building can also be a little hard to see from up close. Producer/reporter Dan Weissmann worked nearby for years and rarely looked up at it. This is apparently by design, as well. The triangular shape keeps the building pushed back from the street, there’s a tall hedge between the sidewalk and the plaza in front of the jail, and the El train blocks the much of the view of the floors above. But recently Dan kind of became obsessed with the MCC and discovered that Harry Weese’s groundbreaking design may still gain admirers from the throngs of people that pass it on the street, but for the 681 temporary residents inside, it may not be living up to Weese’s grand vision.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/99percentinvisible/~4/yYv_z0nJWeM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\">"},{"type":"episode","id":122375888,"slug":"99-invisible-25-unsung-icons-of-soviet-design","explicit":false,"mediaType":"audio/mpeg","title":"99% Invisible-25- Unsung Icons of Soviet Design","url":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~5/kRbxACc_6rs/25-Unsung-Icons-of-Soviet-Design.mp3","home":"http://feeds.99percentinvisible.org/~r/99percentinvisible/~3/m4b2zDI1Toc/","publishedAt":1305258539,"lookup":"https://player.fm/series/116582/122375888.json","share":"https://player.fm/1ZCcbj","size":7709424,"duration":630,"description":"There’s something that links most of the everyday objects presented in “Made in Russia: Unsung Icons of Soviet Design.” But it’s hard to tell exactly what that is just by looking at this collection of wobbly dolls, drinking glasses, primitive arcade games, and arsonistic space heaters.

Chakrabarti also relates this to the current protests in the Middle East. Twitter and Facebook may have had a significant role in organizing the protests, but if there is no place for everyone to gather, what possible change can result? For you podcast listeners (and website streamers) I’ve also added a very 99% Invisible excerpt from Benjamen Walker’s brilliant radio program Too Much Information.

The credit union thought it had something to learn from the check casher about how to reach out and serve the poor. This was curious. McGray’s impression was that check cashers (and especially payday lenders) were predatory, the bad guys, and that credit unions, especially one dedicated to serving the poor, were the good guys. This proposed sale made McGray look at the whole situation with fresh eyes. I highly recommend reading Douglas McGray’s New York Times Magazine article all about it. It’s excellent. I, of course, was drawn to the design aspects of the story. Check cashing stores can feel very odd when you’re not used to them. Quite simply, they are often designed to look and feel more like a corner store. The furnishings are sparse, and the information is on signs— big, bold and clearly presented. Banks, on the other hand, have a design legacy of carpeting, heavy desks, suits, and pamphlets that are hard to parse.

Minimizing the negative is a given that I think everyone understands (and is absolutely critical, no doubt), but it’s the aspect of sustainable design that is also seeking to “maximize the quality of the built environment” that I find really inspiring.
